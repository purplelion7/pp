### About my project
_nothing yet..._

The main objective of Shortening Physical Distance Through Photography (SPDTP) is to create an art piece to make geographical distance less of a barrier between people all over the world. I believe that overcoming this geographical and mental barrier by recognizing that we all share one Earth is the first step in achieving any kind of change on a global level.

The art project has been designed so that it collectively displays pictures of sunrises taken all over the world on the same day on one globe. The 3D globe model will be uploaded online and the feedback will be used to evaluate its efficacy.
